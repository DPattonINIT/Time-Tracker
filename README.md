# Time-Tracker

Peer: Bronel Lazar

review notes: The site looks great overall and aligns with the figma! Few issues, the ellipsis doesnt have a hover effect and the daily, weekly, monthly buttons don't stay lit up when selected, it can also be confusing without the buttons being lit since the data changes on hover. The colored bars are there above each card but they're missing their respective svg icons. Other than that it seems to look good, the mobile looks great as well!
